*HOW TO CREATE A NEW DB In SQL:

We write:

CREATE DATABASE database_name

*   Important concepts of a database:

*Record: This is a tuple inside a table of a ER database.

*Field: This is the column inside a table of a ER database.

*Field value:   This is the value inside the space of a "field" and a "record"


*FIELD TYPES:

*INTEGER:   This is for save numbers in the field.

*TEXT:  This is for save chars and strings in the field.

*BLOB: This is for save binaries like files, videos or images and in general multimedia content in the field.

*REAL:  This is for save floats and numeric information like percentages and that stuff in the field (Important to see that real works with a 8 bytes info and is faster that "NUMERIC" to work).

*NUMERIC:   This is for save in the field by the more specific and accurate way very big numbers, a good example is PI (Numeric field can save data without a limit of bytes and is slower than "REAL" for work).


*A VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL: SQLlite works with a dinamic field system, baically every value field will auto become to the type of data that we put there (this is a bad practice).


*FEATURES OF FIELDS:

    We can write "DEFAULT" for define the value that our field will always have
